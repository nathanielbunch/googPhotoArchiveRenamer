# Goog Photo Archive Renamer
Downloading Google Photo archives is annoying, since all the image file names do not have the date and time for when they were created. This python script will help with changing that.

# How to use
In order to use this script, you will need to download and install [python3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, you can run the script using the following command:
```
python3 ./readGooglePhotoArchives.py -f <YOUR_FOLDER_NAME>
```
The script will then do the rest. This script will parse over subfolders as well (not fully tested btw)!
